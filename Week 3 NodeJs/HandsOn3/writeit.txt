hi!
This is a sample read file for nodeJS programs.
Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
